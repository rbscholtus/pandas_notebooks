# pandas_notebooks

These are the Jupyter notebooks I used for the Introduction to Data Analysis using Python and Pandas tutorial I hosted at FossAsia's OpenTechSummit Vietnam 2019 event.

You can run the notebooks in any Jupyter Notebook installation. The easiest way to get this going is to download and install Anaconda, and start Jupyter from the Start menu. Once it runs, it will launch a browser window with Jupyter. Click File, Open, then find the notebooks on your computer. Don't forget to download the notebooks :)s

Enjoy! <3
